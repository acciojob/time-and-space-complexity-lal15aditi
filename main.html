    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>

        <b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space.
        
        O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>

	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. In other words, time complexity helps us understand how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, ensuring that they perform well even with large datasets.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> is another essential factor in algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem based on the input size. Space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, where <b>n</b> represents the input size. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage and developing efficient algorithms.
